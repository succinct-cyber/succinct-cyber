# Hi, I’m Yomi

I’m a software engineer exploring the intersection of backend development, Web3 systems, and applied research.

This GitHub is intentionally structured as proof of work — small, well-documented projects, technical notes, and experiments that reflect how I think, learn, and build.

## What I work on

1. Backend engineering (Python, Django)

2. Web3 systems and DeFi mechanics

3. Technical research and documentation

4. Turning complex systems into clear explanations


## Featured repositories

1. Web3-notes
Clear, original breakdowns of blockchain, DeFi, and AI x Web3 concepts.

2. Django-labs
Focused backend experiments covering authentication, APIs, subscriptions, and system design.

3. Web3-tools
Lightweight scripts and tools for interacting with blockchain data and Web3 APIs.

4. Content-as-pow
Long-form technical content and research used as verifiable proof of work.

## How to read this GitHub

Each repository includes a README explaining:

    a. the problem being explored

    b. why it matters

    c. how it connects to real-world systems

I value clarity, consistency, and practical understanding over noise.

## Currently learning

    a. Backend system design

    b. Ethereum and Layer 2 architecture

    c. Applied Web3 integrations

    d. Writing better technical documentation
